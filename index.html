                Web Developer
                NEXTBPO Solutions, Inc.
                January 2016 - May 2019
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Designed and developed a custom Wordpress theme for the company and their affiliated organization's website. I am responsible for the coding, design and layout of the theme according to the company's specifications. I used Adobe Photoshop for the design and built the static version of the site using PUGJS (formerly known as Jade) to render the HTML, and SASS for the styles. I used a blank starter theme called Underscores for the theme development where I applied the compiled static site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trained a few OJTs in using Bootstrap. Responsible for teaching the students on how to include the framework on a project using both CDN and compiled CSS, using the components, and for other features. We only used plain HTML during this course.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assisted in developing the front-end part of another project using Bootstrap. After interviewing the intended department for the module and figuring out the necessary pages and features, I built the pages and components using PUGJS then compiled and handed it over to the back-end developers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designed a Mobile App (micro app) using Figma and developed its API using Laravel Lumen to perform the necessary C.R.U.D. operations and provided the Android Developer the endpoints and design assets for consumption.
